# Executable-Stock-Price-Updater

This program is designed to be a desktop executable. It provides the current stock price of 3 companies, which are updateable using a button. 

In addition, the program also allows for the user to search any stock ticker to find its current price. 

The stock information is collected using the 'yfinance' library.

This was my attempt to self-learn the tkinter library to enable me to build basic GUIs in Python.
